# TODO

## High Priority
- [ ] Implement a master hotkey to toggle all other hotkeys on or off. This would allow the same keys to function normally in-game while also serving as keybinds when activated, similar to Dynamic Hotkeys.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Ensure the overlay UI positions correctly when the script is started before the game is launched.
- [ ] Currently hotkey prevents the native function of a key and only performs the hotkey. Add feature to allow also the native function of a key.

## Low Priority
- [ ] Create SHIFT click spam macro.
- [ ] If a game window is closed fast while settings window is open, then tool crashes. Nobody should close the game while settings window is open though.

## Completed
- [x] Fix the issue where Dynamic Hotkeys cannot be used in areas outside the hideout, ensure they work in towns as well.
- [x] Logout macro.
